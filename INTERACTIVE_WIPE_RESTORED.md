# Interactive Wipe Mode Restored

## ‚úÖ Original Interactive Mode Restored

I've successfully restored the **original interactive mode** for `make wipe` that was working before.

### **What's Restored:**

1. **Interactive Confirmation**: `make wipe` now prompts you to type "yes" to confirm
2. **System Status Preview**: Shows running containers, volumes, and networks before confirmation
3. **Safe Cancellation**: Typing anything other than "yes" cancels the operation
4. **Clear Instructions**: Shows exactly what will be wiped

### **How It Works Now:**

```bash
make wipe
```

**Output:**
```
üßπ Environment Wipe Tool
========================

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will DELETE all containers, volumes, and data!

üìã What will be wiped:
   ‚Ä¢ All multimodal containers
   ‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL database volumes
   ‚Ä¢ MinIO object storage volumes
   ‚Ä¢ Redis cache volumes
   ‚Ä¢ All multimodal networks
   ‚Ä¢ Orphaned containers and volumes

üîç Current system status:
   Running containers: 16
   Multimodal volumes: 9
   Multimodal networks: 3

üí° For detailed preview, use: ./scripts/wipe-environment-fixed.sh preview

Type 'yes' to continue with wipe: [WAITING FOR INPUT]
```

### **User Interaction:**
- **Type "yes"** ‚Üí Proceeds with wipe
- **Type anything else** ‚Üí Cancels with "‚ùå Wipe cancelled by user"

### **Available Options:**

1. **Interactive Wipe (Original Mode)**:
   ```bash
   make wipe                    # Interactive confirmation
   ```

2. **Detailed Preview Script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/wipe-environment-fixed.sh preview  # Detailed preview
   ./scripts/wipe-environment-fixed.sh wipe     # Script with confirmation
   ```

3. **Direct Confirmation**:
   ```bash
   make wipe-confirm           # Direct wipe (after preview)
   ```

## üéØ Best of Both Worlds

You now have:
- ‚úÖ **Original interactive mode** restored for `make wipe`
- ‚úÖ **Detailed preview script** available for comprehensive analysis
- ‚úÖ **Multiple wipe options** for different use cases
- ‚úÖ **All extended commands** preserved

The interactive wipe mode is back to working exactly as it was before, with the added benefit of the detailed preview script for when you need more information about what will be deleted.
