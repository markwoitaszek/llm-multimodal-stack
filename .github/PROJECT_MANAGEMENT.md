# 📊 Project Management Guide

This document outlines the project management processes, tools, and workflows for the Multimodal LLM Stack project.

## 🎯 Project Structure

### GitHub Projects Integration

We use **GitHub Projects (Beta)** for project management with automated workflows:

#### Project Boards

|--------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | Trivial | 1-2 hours |
| 2 | Simple | Half day |
| 3 | Medium | 1 day |
| 5 | Complex | 2-3 days |
| 8 | Very Complex | 1 week |
| 13 | Epic | Needs breakdown |
