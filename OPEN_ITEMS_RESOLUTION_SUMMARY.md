**Files Fixed**:
- `services/multimodal-worker/app/config.py`
- `services/ai-agents/app/config.py`
- `services/retrieval-proxy/app/config.py`

### **2. ✅ MoviePy Import Issues**
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'moviepy.editor'`
**Solution**: Mock moviepy.editor import in test files
**Files Fixed**:
- `services/multimodal-worker/tests/test_processors.py`
- `services/multimodal-worker/tests/test_api.py`

### **3. ✅ Storage Test Issues**
**Problem**: S3Error constructor and path generation issues

**Solution**: Created proper `MockAsyncContextManager` class to handle async context manager protocol
**Result**: All 22 database tests now pass with real functionality testing
**Files Fixed**:
- `services/multimodal-worker/tests/test_database.py`

## 🚨 **Remaining Issues**

### **1. ✅ Database Async Context Manager Mocking - RESOLVED**

**Impact**: Only 1 processor test still failing (keyframe extraction mocking)
**Solution Implemented**: Comprehensive module mocking and settings patching

### **4. ⚠️ API Test Issues - PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
**Status**: Partially Fixed (6/20 tests passing)
**Issues Resolved**:
- ✅ Import dependency issues resolved
- ✅ API endpoint path issues resolved
- ✅ Basic endpoint tests working
**Remaining Issues**:
- Async mocking issues with database initialization
- Missing cache_manager attribute in main.py
- Form validation and error handling tests
**Impact**: 14 API tests still failing
**Solution Needed**: Fix async mocking and add missing cache_manager
