# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Multimodal LLM Stack is a comprehensive platform designed to provide AI agent capabilities, IDE integration, workflow automation, and real-time collaboration. This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, components, and their interactions.

## Architecture Principles

### Microservices Architecture
- **Service Independence**: Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Services can use different technologies and frameworks
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't affect others
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled individually based on demand

### Event-Driven Design
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Services communicate through events and messages
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't need direct knowledge of each other
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes are propagated immediately across the system
- **Resilience**: System can handle temporary service unavailability

### API-First Approach
- **RESTful APIs**: Standard HTTP-based communication
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **OpenAPI Specification**: Well-documented APIs for easy integration
- **Versioning**: API versioning for backward compatibility
