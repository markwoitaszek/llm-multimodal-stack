   - **Goal**: "Help users with basic questions"
   - **Tools**: Select "generate_text" and "search_content"
   - **Model**: Choose "gpt-4"
   - **Temperature**: Set to 0.7

4. **Click "Create"**

### Step 2: Execute Your Agent

1. **Find your agent** in the dashboard
2. **Click on the agent** to open its details
3. **In the "Execute Task" section**, enter:
   - **Task**: "What are the benefits of renewable energy?"
4. **Click "Execute Task"**
5. **Watch the execution** in real-time as it progresses

### Step 3: View Results

1. **Check the execution history** to see your agent's work
2. **Review the result** and intermediate steps
3. **Analyze the performance** metrics

## Next Steps
