### 2. Makefile Compliance

**Essential Commands Integration**:
- ✅ Added to `.PHONY` declaration
- ✅ Added to essential help text
- ✅ Added to extended help text
- ✅ No conflicts with existing commands

**Command Naming Convention**:
- ✅ `restart-{env}` for essential environments
- ✅ `restart-{env}-gpu` for GPU variants
- ✅ `restart-{env}-env` for extended environments (avoiding conflicts)

**Backward Compatibility**:
- ✅ All existing commands unchanged
- ✅ All existing workflows preserved
- ✅ New commands are additive only

### 3. Documentation Compliance

**ENHANCED_WORKFLOW_DIAGRAM.md Updates**:
- ✅ Added credential preservation workflow diagram
- ✅ Updated essential commands description
- ✅ Updated credential commands description
- ✅ Added restart commands to command matrix
- ✅ Maintained existing diagram structure

**ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md Updates**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive credential preservation section
- ✅ Updated essential commands list
- ✅ Updated security configuration section
- ✅ Added troubleshooting guidance
- ✅ Updated workflow examples
- ✅ Maintained existing documentation structure

### 4. Technical Implementation Compliance

**Script Integration**:
- ✅ `scripts/preserve-secrets.py` follows existing patterns
- ✅ Uses existing `SimpleSecretsManager` and `TemplateBasedSecretsManager`
- ✅ Maintains existing file structure (`secrets/.env.{env}.json`)
- ✅ Preserves existing `.env.{environment}` files

**Credential Flow Compliance**:
- ✅ Preserves existing credentials by default
- ✅ Validates existing secrets before reusing
- ✅ Only regenerates when forced or missing
- ✅ Maintains Docker Compose compatibility
- ✅ Follows existing security patterns

**Force Regeneration Support**:
- ✅ `setup-secrets-{env}-force` commands added
- ✅ `--force` flag support in preserve-secrets.py
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing setup commands

### 5. Workflow Compliance

**Fresh Start Workflow (Unchanged)**:
```bash
make wipe-nuclear → make setup → make start-staging-gpu
# ✅ Still works exactly as before
```

**Restart Workflow (Enhanced)**:
```bash
# OLD (caused authentication failures)
make stop-staging && make start-staging-gpu

# NEW (preserves credentials)
make restart-staging-gpu
# ✅ Solves authentication issues
```

**Extended Workflows (Preserved)**:
```bash
# All existing extended commands still work
make start-prod-gpu
make start-monitoring
make start-testing
# ✅ No changes to existing functionality
```

### 6. Security Compliance

**Credential Security**:
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Secure credential generation preserved
- ✅ Environment-specific credential management
- ✅ Proper file permissions maintained (600)

**Validation Compliance**:
- ✅ `make validate-credentials-{env}` still works
- ✅ `make validate-security` still works
- ✅ All validation workflows preserved

### 7. Stack-Based Architecture Compliance

**Stack Commands (Unchanged)**:
- ✅ `make restart-core` (existing)
- ✅ `make restart-inference` (existing)
- ✅ `make restart-ai` (existing)
- ✅ `make restart-ui` (existing)
- ✅ `make restart-testing` (existing)
- ✅ `make restart-monitoring` (existing)

**Environment Commands (New)**:
- ✅ `make restart-dev` (new)
- ✅ `make restart-staging` (new)
- ✅ `make restart-prod` (new)
- ✅ `make restart-{env}-gpu` (new)
- ✅ Clear separation between stack and environment restarts

### 8. Network Management Compliance

**Network Commands (Unchanged)**:
- ✅ `make check-network-conflicts` (unchanged)
- ✅ `make validate-networks` (unchanged)
- ✅ `make cleanup-networks` (unchanged)

**Network Preservation**:
- ✅ Restart commands don't affect network configuration
- ✅ Existing network isolation preserved
- ✅ No changes to network management

### 9. Data Management Compliance

**Retention Policies (Unchanged)**:
- ✅ `make retention-{status,cleanup,test}` (unchanged)
- ✅ Existing retention workflows preserved
- ✅ No impact on data retention policies

**Backup System (Unchanged)**:
- ✅ `make backup-{status,full,list,verify}` (unchanged)
- ✅ Existing backup workflows preserved
- ✅ No impact on backup operations

### 10. Testing Framework Compliance

**Testing Commands (Unchanged)**:
- ✅ `make start-testing` (unchanged)
- ✅ `make test-{allure,jmeter,unit,integration}` (unchanged)
- ✅ All testing workflows preserved

**New Testing Support**:
- ✅ `make restart-testing-env` (new)
