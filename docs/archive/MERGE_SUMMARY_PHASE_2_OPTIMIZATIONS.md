## üîß Conflict Resolution Strategy

### Conflicts Resolved
1. **services/memory-system/app/api.py**: Took optimized Phase 2 implementation
2. **services/memory-system/app/database.py**: Took optimized Phase 2 implementation

### Resolution Approach
- **Strategy**: Prioritized the cleaner, optimized Phase 2 implementations
- **Rationale**: Phase 2 implementations were more focused and production-ready
- **Result**: Maintained compatibility while gaining optimization benefits

## üìÅ New Files Added
