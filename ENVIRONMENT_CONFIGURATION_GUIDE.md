# Environment Configuration Guide - LLM Multimodal Stack

## üéØ Overview

The LLM Multimodal Stack uses a **unified schema-driven approach** for environment configuration management. This system centralizes all environment definitions in a single YAML schema file and uses Jinja2 templates to generate secure, consistent configurations across all environments.

**Current Status**: Streamlined Makefile with essential commands by default and all extended functionality preserved. Interactive wipe mode restored with proper preview functionality.

## üîß Environment Management

### Schema-Driven Configuration

The system uses `schemas/compose-schema.yaml` as the single source of truth:

```yaml
# Example schema structure
version: "3.8"

config:
  project_name: "multimodal"
  network_name: "multimodal-net"
  default_restart_policy: "unless-stopped"

services:
  postgres:
    category: "core"
    image: "postgres:16-alpine"
    environment:
      - "POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB}"
      - "POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}"
      - "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"
    volumes_required: ["postgres_data"]
    profiles: ["services", "monitoring"]

environments:
  development:
    description: "Development environment with core services only"
    services: ["postgres", "redis", "qdrant", "minio", "vllm", "litellm"]
    gpu_required: true
    memory_min_gb: 8
```

### Environment Templates

Jinja2 templates in `env-templates/` provide standardized configuration:

```jinja2
# Example: vllm.env.j2
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES={{ cuda_visible_devices | default('0') }}
VLLM_HOST={{ vllm_host | default('0.0.0.0') }}
VLLM_PORT={{ vllm_port | default('8000') }}
VLLM_MODEL_NAME={{ vllm_model_name | default('microsoft/DialoGPT-medium') }}
VLLM_TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE={{ vllm_tensor_parallel_size | default('1') }}
```

## üîí Security Configuration

### Secrets Management

The system uses secure secrets generation with no hardcoded defaults:

```bash
# Generate secure secrets
make setup-secrets

# Validate security configuration
make validate-security
```

**Security Features**:
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded passwords or secrets
- ‚úÖ Environment-specific secret generation
- ‚úÖ Secure defaults with validation
- ‚úÖ Secret rotation capabilities

### Environment Variables

**Required Variables** (no defaults):
```bash
POSTGRES_DB=multimodal
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<generated_secret>
MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=<generated_secret>
JWT_SECRET=<generated_secret>
```

## üßπ Environment Management

### Comprehensive Stop Commands

**‚úÖ Enhanced Stop Functionality:**
- **`make stop`** - Basic stop (main compose file only)
- **`make stop-all`** - **NEW** - Stops ALL services from ALL compose files (recommended)
- **`make stop-dev`** - Stop development environment only
- **`make stop-staging`** - Stop staging environment only  
- **`make stop-prod`** - Stop production environment only
- **`make stop-gpu`** - Stop GPU services only

**Benefits of `make stop-all`:**
- Handles all 15+ compose files in the system
- Includes automatic cleanup of orphaned containers and networks
- Prevents issues with services running from multiple compose files
- Provides clear output showing what's being stopped at each step

### Comprehensive Environment Reset

```bash
# Nuclear wipe (recommended for complete reset)
make wipe-nuclear
# üö® DANGER: This will COMPLETELY DESTROY your entire environment!
# Shows system status and prompts: Type 'NUKE' to confirm

# Legacy wipe (deprecated - use wipe-nuclear instead)
make wipe
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  DEPRECATED: 'make wipe' is deprecated. Use 'make wipe-nuclear' instead.

# Detailed preview wipe (alternative method)
./scripts/wipe-environment-fixed.sh preview  # Detailed preview
./scripts/wipe-environment-fixed.sh wipe     # Script with confirmation

# Nuclear reset option (wipe + setup)
make reset
# Wipes everything + regenerates from scratch
```

**What Gets Wiped (Nuclear)**:
- ALL multimodal containers and services
- ALL PostgreSQL database volumes (DATA LOSS!)
- ALL MinIO object storage volumes (DATA LOSS!)
- ALL Redis cache volumes (DATA LOSS!)
- ALL multimodal networks
- ALL orphaned containers and volumes
- Generated compose files

### Targeted Wipe Options (Extended Commands)

For more granular control, use targeted wipe commands via `make help-extended`:

```bash
# Stack-based wipes (preserve other stacks)
make wipe-core          # Core infrastructure only (postgres, redis, qdrant, minio)
make wipe-inference     # Inference services only (vllm, litellm)
make wipe-ai           # AI services only (multimodal-worker, retrieval-proxy, etc.)
make wipe-ui           # UI services only (openwebui, n8n, nginx)
make wipe-testing      # Testing services only (allure, jmeter)
make wipe-monitoring   # Monitoring services only (prometheus, grafana, elk)

# Data-type wipes (preserve other data)
make wipe-db           # Database volumes only (postgres)
make wipe-cache        # Cache volumes only (redis)
make wipe-models       # Model storage only (minio models bucket)
make wipe-logs         # Log volumes only
```

**Benefits of Targeted Wipes**:
- **Precision**: Only remove what's needed
- **Speed**: Faster than nuclear wipe
- **Safety**: Preserve other stacks and data
- **Debugging**: Isolate specific issues
- **Development**: Quick reset of specific components

### Routine Maintenance

```bash
# Clean up containers and volumes
make clean

# Stop services (choose appropriate command)
make stop                   # Stop main services (basic)
make stop-all               # Stop ALL services from ALL compose files (recommended)
make stop-staging           # Stop staging environment only
make stop-dev               # Stop development environment only

# View logs
make logs

# Check service status
make status
```

## üéÆ GPU Configuration

### Automatic GPU Detection

```bash
# Detect and configure GPU automatically
make detect-gpu
make configure-gpu
make start-gpu-auto
```

### Manual GPU Configuration

```bash
# Run GPU configuration script directly
./scripts/configure-gpu.sh auto      # Auto-detect and configure
./scripts/configure-gpu.sh multi     # Force multi-GPU setup
./scripts/configure-gpu.sh single    # Force single GPU setup
./scripts/configure-gpu.sh cpu       # CPU-only mode
```

### GPU Environment Variables

```

### NVLink Optimization

#### **RTX 3090 NVLink Configuration**
The RTX 3090 supports NVLink 3.0 with the following specifications:
- **Bandwidth**: 600 GB/s bidirectional
- **Latency**: Ultra-low latency for GPU-to-GPU communication
- **Topology**: Direct GPU-to-GPU connection

- **Communication**: NVLink enables fast inter-GPU communication
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces per-GPU memory requirements
- **Performance**: Near-linear scaling with proper NVLink setup
