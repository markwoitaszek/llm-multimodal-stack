# Comprehensive Makefile Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Your original Makefile was **overbearing and unusable** with 808 lines and 100+ commands. You wanted to keep the extended options while having simplified essential commands for easy GPU-enabled dev/staging environments and reliable wipe functionality.

## ✅ Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### **Best of Both Worlds:**
- ✅ **Essential Commands** - Streamlined, focused on daily use
- ✅ **Extended Commands** - All original functionality preserved
- ✅ **Fixed Wipe Functionality** - Working preview and confirmation
- ✅ **GPU Support** - Simple, integrated GPU commands

## 🚀 Your New Makefile Structure

### **Default View (Essential Commands):**
```bash
make help              # Shows essential commands only
```

**Essential Commands:**
```bash
# Setup & Environment Management
make setup              # Complete setup from scratch
make start-dev          # Start development environment
make start-staging      # Start staging environment
make start-dev-gpu      # Start development with GPU support
make start-staging-gpu  # Start staging with GPU support

# Management
make stop               # Stop all running services
make wipe               # Show wipe preview and instructions
make wipe-confirm       # Confirm wipe (after preview)
make reset              # Nuclear reset (wipe + setup)
make status             # Show service status
make logs               # View service logs

# GPU Management
make detect-gpu         # Detect GPU configuration
make configure-gpu      # Configure GPU settings
```

### **Extended View (All Commands):**
```bash
make help-extended      # Shows ALL commands (100+)
```

**Extended Commands Include:**
- 📄 **Schema & Compose Commands** (5 commands)
- 🔐 **Secret Management Commands** (4 commands)
- 🔒 **Credential Validation Commands** (4 commands)
